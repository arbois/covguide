# web site for the F&B Coronavirus Guide





## Helping out

We would love help making this more efficient and easier to use. 

Built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [netlify](http://netlify.com). Should be super simple to get going. 

Guide data is in `/data`. Content is in `/content`. Homepage content is in `/content/_index.md`

stylesheet and assets are in `/static`
