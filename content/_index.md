## What it is, why it’s bad—and how you can help

---

This guide is specifically written to help people in the F&B industry reduce the risk of their businesses accidentally spreading Coronavirus (aka Covid-19). 

The suggestions here are low/no-cost and are generally good practice—they have also been evaluated by epidemiologists, public health experts, biologists, and doctors.

We'll update the English version of the guide continually to incorporate comments and new developments as we learn more about coronavirus. 

These are the most current PDF versions of the guide.
