## What it is, why it’s bad—and how you can help

These two guides are specifically written to help businesses in the F&B industry respond during Coronavirus (aka Covid-19) outbreaks. They are relevant both during lockdowns and when F&B businesses are allowed to re-open. 

The suggestions here are low/no-cost and are generally good practice—they have also been evaluated by epidemiologists, public health experts, biologists, and doctors.
